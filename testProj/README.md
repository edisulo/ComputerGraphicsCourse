# 3D PDF Book Viewer
This repository contains a project developed as part of my Computer Graphics Course. The project is a 3D PDF Book Viewer where users can upload a PDF file and experience its content in an interactive 3D environment.

# Overview
The main objective of this project was to explore and experiment with modern 3D graphics on the web using three.js. By integrating PDF viewing into a 3D space, I aimed to combine traditional document reading with immersive, interactive 3D visualization.

# Features
3D PDF Upload: Upload your own PDF to have it rendered on a 3D object.
Interactive Navigation: Explore the 3D environment with intuitive controls.
Dynamic Lighting & Animation: Experience the document with enhanced visual effects, including custom lighting and smooth animations.
Technologies Used
three.js: For creating and rendering the 3D scene.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the project.
JavaScript: For all the interactive and dynamic functionalities.
Getting Started
To run the project locally:

# Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ComputergraphicsCourse.git

# Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd ComputergraphicsCourse/testProj
Launch the Application:

Open index.html in your web browser (a modern browser with WebGL support is recommended).

Learning and Experimentation
During this course, I have experimented with several key concepts in computer graphics, including:

3D Object Manipulation: Loading and controlling 3D objects within a scene.
Texture Mapping: Applying PDF pages as textures on 3D surfaces.
Interactive Animations: Enhancing user experience with dynamic, responsive animations.
Performance Optimization: Ensuring smooth rendering even with complex 3D scenes.
These experiments have significantly deepened my understanding of both web development and 3D graphics programming.

Future Improvements
Enhanced User Interface: Refining the UI for better usability.
Multi-PDF Support: Allowing users to upload and manage multiple PDFs.
Advanced 3D Effects: Experimenting with more sophisticated lighting, shadows, and animations.
