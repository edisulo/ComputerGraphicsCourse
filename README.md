# Welcome to My Computer Graphics Course Repository!

Hello and welcome! This repository houses projects developed as part of my Computer Graphics Course, where I experimented with modern 3D graphics using technologies like [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

If you're interested in testing out the main project—the 3D PDF Book Viewer—please navigate to the `testProj` folder. There you'll find everything you need to run the project locally and explore its interactive, immersive features.

Enjoy exploring and experimenting with the code!
